# Ani-Query
Small Python script for watching anime from the command prompt (Currently only for Windows).

# Current Version: v.1.0
Finally made it to v1.0. I've been working on this script for a long time. I been learning how to code *on and off* for about 2 years and this is my first publicly available *big project*. Enjoy.

# Download
Download the GitHub repo and use pip to install the required modules via [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt).
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then run the aniquery.py file and you should be good to go :)

# Goals:
- [ ] Add a database of anime previously watched using json。
- [x] Improve code quality。
- [ ] Add MacOS Support。
